## AB

100% For AB

70% For BC

### Limits & Cont'd

#### BASIC:

LEFT ≠ RIGHT >> lim x->c f(x) doesn't exist.


When x->infinity, please ignore small constants or terms with low power.


---

#### Evaluate Limits

- Substitution


If substitution doesn't work: 0/0!


- Try to factorize then cancel something causing 0/0


If factorization doesn't work:


- **L.H** (ONlY FOR INDETERMINATES LIKE: 0/0, infinity/infinity, infinity*0...etc.)


---


#### For prove 'f(x) is cont'd at x = c'

There are 3 STEPS must be met:


- f(c) exists (when answering questions, write f(c) = 'specific value')

- lim x->c f(x) exists (FIRST prove 'LEFT = RIGHT', if yes, lim x->c f(x) = 'specific value')

- lim x->c f(x) = f(c)


If any of the 3 steps is not met, there is a discontinuity.

**3 Type of Discontinuity**

- removable (you CAN cancel it)

- jump (you CANNOT cancel, and **LEFT ≠ RIGHT**)

- infinite(LEFT or RIGHT = infinity)


---


#### IVT

STEPS:

- Check if cont'd 

- if yes, calculate the value of the function at the **endpoints** of given x interval)

- Compare if the given value is between the 2 you calculated -> IVT works!

- Make your Conclusion



### Slope (Derivatives)

**Check if differentiable before answering**

Instant. Rate of Change = lim h->0 Avg. Rate of Change

When asking 'estimate IRC at x=c using values in the TABLE' :

- Use MVT if differentiable (OF COURSE!)

  Choose two 'x' closest to 'c' (One Right and One Left), then just do what you usually do for ARC.

---

if f' > 0

For Calculating Derivatives:

DON'T:
- forget the 'USEFUL USUAL DERIVATIVES'
- forget about CHAIN RULE
- forget to check (redo) if you have remaining time
- SKIP STEPS
